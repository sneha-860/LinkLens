# LinkLens — Internal Link Auditor

This file is the authoritative project spec. Read it before changing anything.

## Overview

LinkLens crawls a public site (500-page cap, robots.txt-compliant per RFC 9309), stores raw link
observations **append-only**, and derives graphs under six versioned canonicalisation policies
(**P0–P5**).

## Discovery channels & orphans

LinkLens detects orphans by reconciling six discovery channels, with **per-channel provenance**:

1. Link graph
2. XML sitemap
3. robots.txt `Sitemap:` directives
4. HTML sitemap
5. RSS/Atom
6. llms.txt

## Graph metrics

PageRank, BFS depth, strongly connected components (SCC), betweenness, and in/out degrees.

## Semantic layer

Adapted from patent **US 11,586,824 B2** (Belezko & McGoey, 2023).

- Directional containment: `REF(A,B) = |S_A ∩ S_B| / |S_B|`
  - `S_A = Links(A) ∪ Body(A)`
  - `S_B = Title(B) ∪ Body(B)`
- Computed over **field-aware, site-specific TF-IDF token sets**, with an **ε cutoff** and
  **per-node normalisation**.
- The patent's session-based popularity is replaced by a **structural link-prominence proxy**.
  Always call it **"prominence"**, never "popularity" (in code, docs, UI and variable names).

### Four-case diagnosis

| Label | Meaning              |
| ----- | -------------------- |
| v4    | missing              |
| v3    | buried               |
| v2    | good                 |
| v1    | misleading/low-value |

## Fix simulation & ranking

- A fix is simulated by adding an edge to a **copy** of the graph and recomputing PageRank.
- Fixes are ranked by `S(u→v) = ΔPR_v × σ_hybrid(u,v) / κ(u)`
  - `σ_hybrid(u,v) = cosine(u,v)` if `REF > ε`, else `0`
  - `κ(u)` = editing effort
- Every fix carries a **rule-based explanation**.
- Orphans get **"rescue" donors**.

## Evaluation

| --- | ---------------------------- |
| E1  | Canonicalisation sensitivity |
| E2  | Channel ablation             |
| E3  | Fixes vs baselines           |
| E4  | 14-day re-crawl stability    |
| E5  | Screaming Frog calibration   |
| E6  | Hide-and-recover             |
| E7  | σ ablation                   |
| E8  | Human rating (optional)      |

## Principles (non-negotiable)

- Raw data is **never normalised on write**.
- Every derived artefact stores the **policy version and run id**.
- **All thresholds live in one config file**: `packages/core/src/config.ts`. No magic numbers elsewhere.
- **Determinism**: fixed seeds (`randomSeed` in config).
- **Every module has unit tests.**

## Repo conventions

- pnpm workspaces; TypeScript strict; ESLint (flat config) + Prettier; Vitest.
- `packages/core`: pure algorithms, **no I/O** (no `fs`, `http`, `net`, `fetch`, `pg`). ESLint enforces this.
  - `core/src/db`: row types + typed query helpers for the schema. Helpers take an injected
    `Queryable`; core never imports a driver or opens a connection.
- `packages/db`: `pg` pool, `Queryable` adapter, SQL migrations (node-pg-migrate, `migrations/*.sql`),
  and integration tests against the docker-compose Postgres.
- `packages/crawler`: fetching, robots.txt, raw observation storage.
- `packages/api`: Express HTTP API.
- `packages/web`: React + Vite UI.
- `packages/eval`: experiments E1–E8.
- `analysis/`: Python statistics (not part of the pnpm workspace).

### Crawler politeness (packages/crawler)

- robots.txt (`src/robots/`) follows RFC 9309:
  - The crawler's product token (from `config.userAgent`) is matched case-insensitively. Every
    group naming it is merged; if none does, every `*` group is merged instead.
  - Longest match wins; on a tie, Allow wins.
  - `*` and a trailing `$` are wildcards; `%2A` and `%24` are the literal characters. Percent-encoding
    is normalised before comparison, never on storage.
  - A 4xx response, or more than `robotsMaxRedirects` redirects, means allow all. A 5xx, network
    error or timeout means disallow all. `/robots.txt` itself is always allowed.
  - `Sitemap:` lines are collected raw with line numbers; they are a discovery channel.
- Politeness: a per-host capacity-1 token bucket spaces requests
  `max(config.crawlDelayMs, robots Crawl-delay)` apart. The robots.txt value can only slow us down.
  `acquire()` also enforces that gap since the previous _actual_ dispatch, because timers fire late.
- `createRun` refuses a User-Agent without a product token, a version and a `(+https://…)` contact.

### Crawl orchestrator (packages/crawler/src/orchestrator.ts)

- BullMQ on Redis: one queue per run (`crawl-run-<id>`). Job priority is depth + 1, which gives BFS
  order. `crawlConcurrency = 1` (the default) keeps the order deterministic.
- Frontier state in Redis: a seen-set plus an admitted counter, updated by one atomic Lua script.
  At most `pageCap` URLs are admitted.
- Dedupe key = WHATWG-resolved URL with the fragment dropped (fragments are never sent to the
  server). Nothing else is normalised: case, trailing slashes, queries and index files stay as they are.
- Before every request, including each redirect hop: check scope, check robots.txt, wait on the
  per-host bucket. Redirects are followed manually and each hop is stored as
  `{url, statusCode, location}`.
- Every attempt is a `fetches` row, including robots.txt fetches, retries and robots-blocked URLs
  (the blocked ones have `status_code = null` and an error).
- Only 2xx HTML is parsed, into `pages` and `link_observations`. A redirect target that is already
  in the frontier is not re-extracted.
- 5xx, network errors and timeouts are retried up to `fetchMaxRetries` times with exponential
  backoff. 4xx is never retried.
- `cancel()` aborts the in-flight request, closes the worker, obliterates the queue, clears the
  frontier keys and sets the run to `cancelled`.
- Events: `progress` (pagesFetched, queueSize, admitted, url, depth, outcome), `done`, `error`.

### Database

- Postgres 16 + Redis 7 via `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres on host port **5433**).
- Schema changes are **new** SQL migrations only (`pnpm --filter @linklens/db migrate:create <name>`);
  never edit an applied migration.
- `link_observations` and `discovery_observations` are **append-only**, enforced by triggers that
  reject UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE (SQLSTATE 23001). Core exposes only insert/list for them.
- Every `artefacts` row has non-null `run_id` and `policy_version`.
- Integration tests create a throwaway database per run and drop it afterwards.
